    "# Advanced Techniques for Entity Resolution and Duplicate Detection\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the realm of data management and analysis, ensuring data quality is of paramount importance. Duplicates in datasets can lead to skewed results and erroneous insights. Entity resolution, the process of identifying and consolidating duplicate records that pertain to the same real-world entity, plays a critical role in enhancing data accuracy. This Jupyter notebook delves into advanced techniques for entity resolution and duplicate detection, leveraging Token Blocking and Meta-Blocking methodologies. The notebook follows a structured approach to address the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task A: Token Blocking for Block Creation\n",
    "In this task, we explore the concept of Token Blocking, a schema-agnostic approach that facilitates the creation of blocks using Key-Value (K-V) pairs. These K-V pairs represent distinctive Blocking Keys (BKs) derived from entity attribute values. Notably, the identifier column (id) is excluded from the blocking process. By transforming attribute strings to lowercase during token creation, the potential for mismatches is mitigated. The outcome is an index of comprehensively derived BKs. The generated index is meticulously presented using a function designed for clear and readable Key-Value pair visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task B: Calculating All Possible Comparisons\n",
    "Task B is dedicated to computation – we calculate all conceivable comparisons required for resolving duplicates within the blocks established in Task A. By quantifying the final number of comparisons, we gain insights into the computational complexity inherent in the duplicate detection process. This step sets the stage for efficient and accurate entity resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task C: Constructing a Meta-Blocking Graph with CBS Weighting\n",
    "Task C introduces the concept of Meta-Blocking – a strategy involving the creation of a graph based on the block collection crafted in Task A. To enhance the graph's effectiveness, the CBS (Common Block Scheme) Weighting Scheme is employed. Edges with weights below 2 are pruned, streamlining the block collection and minimizing unnecessary comparisons. The revised block collection post pruning serves as the foundation for recalculating the final number of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task D: Jaccard Similarity Function for Attribute Comparison\n",
    "The final task introduces a custom function designed for assessing Jaccard similarity between two entities. The attribute \"title\" is the focus of comparison. Although actual comparisons aren't performed within this notebook, the function serves as an indispensable tool for gauging similarity in attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this comprehensive notebook, readers will gain proficiency in employing advanced techniques for entity resolution and duplicate detection. By leveraging real-world data and following the step-by-step instructions provided, participants will enhance their data manipulation skills and contribute to better data quality and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook rigorously addresses each task, offering a harmonious blend of meticulous explanations and meticulously crafted code implementations. By actively engaging with the content presented herein, readers will cultivate a profound comprehension of the foundational concepts and intricate techniques that form the bedrock of efficacious entity resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to underscore that the present notebook constitutes an integral component within the broader landscape of our comprehensive analysis. This notebook is intricately interwoven with the accompanying documentation in PDF format, which provides an expansive contextual framework and supplementary insights to enrich the overall understanding of the complex entity resolution process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you navigate through the following sections, each task is elegantly demarcated to facilitate focused exploration. Equipped with both theoretical insights and practical applications, this notebook endeavors to empower readers with the analytical skills necessary to wield advanced techniques in entity resolution adeptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Therefore the contents within this notebook, complemented by the accompanying documentation, synergistically contribute to a holistic and profound grasp of the intricate subject matter at hand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*The current analysis will be done on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and in [Python 3.10.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).*\n",

    "## Libraries\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will leverage various Python libraries to implement advanced techniques for entity resolution and duplicate detection. Each library has a specific role in enabling us to achieve accurate and efficient results. Below, we list the libraries that will be imported and provide an interpretation of their significance within our analysis. These libraries are essential for Advanced Techniques in Entity Resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a fundamental data manipulation library that provides powerful tools for data analysis and preprocessing. We will use it to load and manipulate our dataset, perform attribute transformations, and handle tabular data structures efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: NLTK is a library that offers a wide range of natural language processing capabilities. We will use it for text preprocessing tasks, such as transforming strings to lowercase, and for tokenization of attribute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NetworkX**: NetworkX is a graph analysis library that provides tools for creating, visualizing, and analyzing complex networks. We will use NetworkX to construct and analyze the Meta-Blocking graph in Task C.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a widely-used plotting library that enables us to create visualizations. We will use it to generate graphs and plots for illustrating our analysis results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Collections**: The `collections` module provides specialized container datatypes and functions. We will use the `defaultdict` class from this module to create our Meta-Blocking graph more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Itertools**: The `itertools` module offers fast, memory-efficient tools for working with iterators. We will use the `combinations` function to calculate all possible comparisons in Task B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these libraries plays a crucial role in supporting our entity resolution tasks. As we progress through the notebook, we will illustrate how these libraries are employed to implement different techniques and methodologies, contributing to the successful completion of the assignment's tasks.\n"
